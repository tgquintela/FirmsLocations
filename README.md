# Firms Geospatial data study

Study and quantify the influence of the spatial data selection in the performance of a firm.
The performance of a firm is a complex output of the complex interaction of many heterogenous variables which ranges from taking profit to market oportunity, quality of management, robust base of customers, possibility to make get strong margins of prices from the suppliers...

Most of these quantities are hidden from the public data usually and there are very difficult to quantify from them.

The spatial neighbourhood of the firms could determine what type of firm it is but also it could give us clues of how good or bad it is the place decision taking into account data of the whole firms ecosystem and performances in the past or other regions.
